## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Semantic HTML: I used it to organize the content meaningfully.
- Reusable Classes: I created reusable classes like text-bold for bold text and horizontal-line for styling dividers.
- Responsive Design: I ensured the page is fully responsive.

Here’s an example of the HTML structure I’m proud of:

```html
<div class="preparation-time">
  <h3>Preparation time</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="text-bold">Total:</span> Approximately 10 minutes</li>
    <li><span class="text-bold">Preparation:</span> 5 minutes</li>
    <li><span class="text-bold">Cooking:</span> 5 minutes</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Continued development

CSS Grid: Experimenting with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

Animations: Adding subtle animations to enhance user experience.
